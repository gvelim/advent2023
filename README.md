# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, implemented in Rust. Each day presents unique algorithmic problems that explore different programming concepts and data structures.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming event created by Eric Wastl. It consists of 25 daily programming puzzles released each December, designed to be solvable with any programming language. The puzzles typically increase in difficulty as the days progress.

## Project Structure

Solutions are organized by day in the `src/bin` directory. Each day contains:
- Source code for the solution
- A README explaining the problem and approach
- Input data (if applicable)

To run a specific day's solution:
```
cargo run --bin dayX
```
Where X is the day number (1-25).
