# Day 11: Cosmic Expansion

## Input
The researcher has collected a bunch of data and compiled the data into a single giant image (your puzzle input). The image includes **empty space** `.` and **galaxies** `#`. For example:
```
  Input           Gaps                Expanded Space

## Part 1
The researcher is trying to figure out the **sum of the lengths of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies**. However, there's a catch: the universe expanded in the time it took the light from those galaxies to reach the observatory.

Due to something involving gravitational effects, **only some space expands**. In fact, the result is that any rows or columns **that contain no galaxies** should all actually be twice as big.

Expand the universe, then find the length of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies. What is the sum of these lengths?
